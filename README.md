## About
I am a Highschooler who codes in his free time. My main languages are [Python](https://www.python.org/), [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), and [TI-BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-BASIC) (not really). I enjoy finding problems and finding creative solutions to them.
